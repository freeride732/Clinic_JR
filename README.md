Jr clinic code dump

The purpose of this repository is for devolping code to do realtime sampling and prioritizing of
multiple sensor units, and compiling that data to produce meaningful results, either databases or graphical in nature.

This code was devolped as part of Dr. Thomas Lad Merril's Engineering Clinic Course at Rowan University during
the Fall of 2013.
